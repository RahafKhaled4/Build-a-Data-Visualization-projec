# Build-a-Data-Visualization-projec

- In this project, I'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. 
Will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set.
Work  be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

- I chose Dataset from a Kaggle " Flight Delays and Cancellations " : link here: https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays/data.

## My Project

### Dashboard 1

### - Summary:
The above dashboard describes the average for canceling flights both 
country and states, through analysis dashboard, is deriving country "USA" and state 
"VT" is highest average canceled is aquale"0.04469”, It also shows the least average 
state is “HI”.

### - Designee: 
in the dashboard display above I use map because clear country and state 
also property to solve question through Displays the highest, lowest, and average 
places by the intensity of the degree of colors, in additions use bar chart to show 
numbers average with state.

### - Summary:
The above figure describes the weather delay in each month through 
analysis line chart the most delayed month is “2” and weather delay equal is 
“24,203 minutes”, It also shows the least month “9” and weather delay equal is 
“8,897 minutes”.

### - Designee:
Use line chart because is the best type of chart to plot numerical data 
when a chronology is required.

### - Summary:
The above bar chart describes the airline delay rate in each airline as
shown airlines “WN” it has highest delay rate is “182,670 km”, It also shows the 
least delay is “VX” which rate is “7,583 km”.

### - Designee:
Use bar chart is the best type to show segments of information, in 
additions useful to compare different categorical, I choice color Indigo blue to 
simulate the colors of the sky.
