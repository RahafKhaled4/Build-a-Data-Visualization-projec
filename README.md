# Build-a-Data-Visualization-projec

- In this project, I'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. 
Will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set.
Work  be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

- I chose Dataset from a Kaggle " Flight Delays and Cancellations " : link here: https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays/data.
